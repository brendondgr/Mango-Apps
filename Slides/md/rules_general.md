# Slide Rules Overview
## Description
General rules for creating markdown documents that outline PowerPoint slides for any topic presentation.

## Structure
It should have a defined structure, specifically two sections:
1. Overview of the main content/topic
2. Breakdown of Overview into PowerPoint Slides

### 1. Overview
Structured by giving bulleted points describing key information about the topic. Include details about accomplishments, findings, implementations, or main points. Provide context, outcomes, and any challenges or considerations. Ask user for more details if something is unclear or lacks information.

Example:
```md
- Analyzed market trends for Q4: Identified significant growth in digital adoption, but noted challenges with supply chain disruptions.
- Launched new customer portal: Successfully deployed with positive user feedback, though initial load times need optimization.
- Conducted team training sessions: Completed all modules, highlighted knowledge gaps in advanced features requiring additional documentation.
```
