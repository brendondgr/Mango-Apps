## Reflection

Dr. Thorne discussed where quantum computing stands today, emphasizing that the field is in the "NISQ" phase—past the purely theoretical stage but not yet at practical usefulness. This description seemed useful for understanding the current state of the technology.

The main technical obstacles were outlined as decoherence and error correction. The analogy to 1940s vacuum tube computers made sense; current quantum hardware is powerful but difficult to work with. The No-Cloning Theorem was mentioned as a fundamental constraint—it takes thousands of physical qubits to create a single reliable logical qubit, which is a significant problem for building practical systems.

The speaker covered some approaches being developed to address these issues. Topological qubits using anyons and braiding was presented as one option. Another approach involves hybrid algorithms like VQE and QAOA, which work within current hardware limitations. These seem like more realistic near-term options.

The applications discussed made the relevance clearer. Shor's Algorithm poses a threat to current encryption, which is why there's already work on Post-Quantum Cryptography. Quantum computers also appear suited for simulating molecular systems, since classical computers struggle with the computational scaling involved.

Dr. Thorne gave a timeline of 3–5 years for "Quantum Advantage" and 10–15 years for full fault tolerance. The talk also mentioned the "Quantum Divide"—the concern about who will have access to quantum computing technology and what that might mean for inequality.

Overall, the presentation made clear that quantum computing is an active field with concrete progress being made, though still facing significant technical hurdles. The discussion covered both the technical aspects and practical applications.
