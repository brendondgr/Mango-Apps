# Weekly Update: 2025-11-14

## 1. Overview
- **Applied Computational Sciences Midterm:** Completed the midterm successfully. Created a comprehensive study PDF which will be maintained and expanded for Preliminary Exams.
- **MIMIC Data Access:** Began gaining access to two major datasets. MIMIC-CXR (Chest X-Rays, EHR, reports) with over 377k data points, and MIMIC-IV containing detailed hospitalization data for over 223k individuals.
- **Local LLM Module:** Worked on the module, primarily implementing memory through the use of KV Cache.
- **Laboratory Website:** Continued development on the website structure and features.
