# User Interface & Design System

This document outlines the **"Vibrant UI"** design system used across the application. The interface is designed to be modern, high-energy, and premium, balancing functional data density with a playful, interactive aesthetic.

## 🎨 Color Palette

The application uses a carefully curated color system defined in `variables.css`.

### Brand Colors

- **Primary (Electric Coral):** `#FF6B6B` — Main buttons, primary actions, and brand highlights.
- **Secondary (Deep Indigo):** `#4C3BCF` — Navigation, info states, and secondary focus.
- **Tertiary (Vivid Teal):** `#00D9C0` — Success states and teal accents.

### Neutral Base

- **Background:** `#FEFBF6` (Warm Off-White) — Avoids clinical white for a softer feel.
- **Surface:** `#FFF8F0` (Soft Cream) — Used for cards and secondary panels.
- **Elevated:** `#FFFFFF` — Pure white used for modals and floating elements.

### Categorization Tones

The application features 16 predefined color sets used for classifying various data types or categories. Each category follows a consistent three-tone implementation:

1.  **Low-opacity Background:** For the main container area.
2.  **Saturated Border:** For clear visual categorization.
3.  **High-contrast Text:** For maximum legibility.

| Name              | Background (HEX) | Border/Accent (HEX) | Text (HEX) |
| :---------------- | :--------------- | :------------------ | :--------- |

## ✨ Design Philosophy & Style Choices

### 1. Modern Typography

- **Headings:** `Space Grotesk` — A geometric typeface that provides a modern, high-tech personality.
- **Body:** `DM Sans` — Chosen for high legibility in information-dense views.
- **Mono:** `JetBrains Mono` — Used for labels, numerical values, and metadata to emphasize the data-driven focus of the interface.

### 2. Modular Glassmorphism

The app makes extensive use of transparency and depth to feel "layered":

- **Glass headers:** Uses `backdrop-filter: blur(12px)` to allow underlying content to blur beautifully as it scrolls underneath.
- **Themed Glows:** Interactive elements like the Primary Button use themed glows (e.g., `rgba(255, 107, 107, 0.3)`) on hover, making the UI feel "alive."

### 3. Soft Geometry

- **Border Radii:** Generous rounding is applied throughout (`6px` to `24px`). Modals and segmented controls use high radii to soften the technical nature of the grid.
- **Elevation:** A 5-step shadow system (`xs` to `xl`) creates clear spatial hierarchy for overlapping components like tooltips, dropdowns, and modals.

### 4. Interactive Fidelity

- **Micro-animations:** Segmented controls and toggles use "spring" bezier curves (`cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1)`) for a snappy, responsive feel.
- **Interactive Cards:** Component cards feature a hover lift effect (`translateY(-2px)`) and a slight scale up (`1.01x`) to provide immediate feedback.

## 🖼️ SVG Icon System

Icons are treated as part of the brand identity and use the following color mappings:

| Function | Brand Color | HEX | File Name |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Actions** | Primary (Electric Coral) | `#FF6B6B` | `icon-action-coral.svg` |
| **Management/Edit** | Secondary (Deep Indigo) | `#4C3BCF` | `icon-edit-indigo.svg` |
| **Creation/Success** | Tertiary (Vivid Teal) | `#00D9C0` | `icon-add-teal.svg` |
| **Danger/Destruction**| Red (Categorization Tone) | `#ef4444` | `icon-delete-red.svg` |

## 📱 Responsive Strategy

The design uses a mobile-first approach:

- **Dynamic Layouts:** Complex structures persist across breakpoints, but container minimum widths are enforced with horizontal scrolling to maintain legibility.
- **Component Swapping:** Small icon-only variants replace labelled components on smaller screens to preserve space.
- **Responsive Sizing:** CSS variables are manipulated via scripts to adjust interface density based on device width.

## 🧭 Interaction Patterns

### 1. In-App Popups & Modals

To maintain the premium "ShortSpork" experience, browser-native dialogs are strictly prohibited. 

- **No `alert()`, `confirm()`, or `prompt()`**: All user confirmations, errors, and inputs must use custom in-app modal components.
- **Glassmorphism Backdrop**: Modals should appear over a blurred, semi-transparent overlay to maintain context while focusing the user's attention.
- **Spring Entrance**: Modals must animate in using the brand's spring curves for a tactile feel.
- **Destructive Actions**: Confirmation for destructive actions (like Deleting a recipe) must clearly use the brand's Danger red for primary confirmation buttons.
