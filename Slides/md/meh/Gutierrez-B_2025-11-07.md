## Reflection

AI Agents are a field of interest to me since my own personal research aligns with this, but with a more specific emphasis in Healthcare research. I think this research is important as a lot of fields are able to benefit from its applications given the broadness of how it can be applied.

Overall, while I enjoyed the speaker's talk, it seemed to me that it did not fully explore what agents really are and how they are applied. Perhaps I misinterpreted the purpose of the talk. The presentation began with Transformer architecture (which is fine, but not entirely pertinent to how Agents function) and then transitioned into the speaker's personal research.

Unfortunately, I had to leave a little early due to another Seminar starting at 3:05 PM, which coincided with the ending time of this Colloquium. It is possible that I missed some additional details. Regardless, I find the topic of Agents fascinating and believe it is something more people should be aware of.
