# Monthly Update: December 2025 - January 2026

## 1. Overview
- **GitHub Contributions**: I recorded ~200 commits since the last meeting (180 this month), marking a high-velocity development phase.
- **Manny Bot Expansion**: I transitioned Manny from a personal tool to a multi-purpose bot for Personal, Pulse Lab, and AI Seminar servers with moderation, stats, and automation.
- **Pulse Lab & App Suite**: I built a Markdown/LaTeX blog and a suite of 7 applications (Calendar, Project Manager, etc.) to streamline my workflows.
- **MIMIC-IV Research**: I navigated the 6 TB dataset and 1 Billion+ rows of data. I created a database mindmap to simplify navigation.
