# Weekly Update - October 20, 2025

## Overview

- **AIMLHealth Project 1: Heart Disease Classification** - Created a front-end for the project and completed the Random Forest model for the Framingham Heart Study data. However, the ensemble learning system still needs additional models to be fully operational for comparative analysis.
- **Courses** - Continued coursework throughout the week with limited specific deliverables, but maintained consistent engagement with learning materials.
- **Article Reading** - Read several articles focused on Heart Disease and Machine Learning, which provided valuable insights and guidance for refining the AIMLHealth Project strategy and model selection.
- **Lab Website + Logo** - The website is largely complete with core functionality implemented. The logo conversion to SVG encountered technical challenges due to thin line rendering limitations. Additional features planned include User Profiles with login credentials and Blog pages for project showcasing. SEO optimization pending.
